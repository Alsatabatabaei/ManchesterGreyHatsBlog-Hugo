      <description>Presented by: Brett
Every day, every hour, minute, second we spend online posting about what we&amp;rsquo;ve eaten and where we&amp;rsquo;ve been we&amp;rsquo;re creating a massive footprint about ourselves and others that can be scarily easily used against us; of course this can also be used in our favour as well! In this workshop I&amp;rsquo;ll be giving you a really high-level overview of the capabilities of OSINT and what we can all do with it - from building ideas about our own habits, to criminal organisations, to the spread of ideas around the world.</description>
