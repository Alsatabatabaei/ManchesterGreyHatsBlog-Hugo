      <description>Presented by: Jay
Software Defined Radio (SDR) is a cheap and easy way to listen to and interact with radio devices. In this workshop, we&amp;rsquo;ll look at the capabilities of SDR, discuss common weaknesses in radio systems (such as wireless keyfobs and wireless keyboard) and look into ways these can be exploited with cheap and readily available hardware.
For this workshop, you will need a laptop with gnuradio companion, SDR# or qqrx and capable of running SDR drivers (these should all be available in Kali Linux).</description>
