        Presented by: Brett
Every day, every hour, minute, second we spend online posting about what we&rsquo;ve eaten and where we&rsquo;ve been we&rsquo;re creating a massive footprint about ourselves and others that can be scarily easily used against us; of course this can also be used in our favour as well! In this workshop I&rsquo;ll be giving you a really high-level overview of the capabilities of OSINT and what we can all do with it - from building ideas about our own habits, to criminal organisations, to the spread of ideas around the world.

        Presented by: Tim
USB devices have been with us now for over 20 years. They have posed a security risk to organisations, which is not always as understood as well as it could be. This workshop will look at USB devices and how they work, including practical exercises in making your own USB keyboard perform tasks on your behalf.
The workshop doesn&rsquo;t assume any prior knowledge of programming, but a background in C and/or powershell would be useful.

        Presented by: Jay
In this workshop, we&rsquo;ll look at the common vulnerabilities found in web applications such as XSS, SQL Injection, CSRF etc and learn how to discover and exploit them.
To join in with the exercises, you&rsquo;ll need a laptop with a web browser, ZAP or burpsuite and Hackazon running inside a VM.
This workshop is aimed at beginners so if you&rsquo;re already familiar with web app security, you may not get a huge amount from this (although we&rsquo;d love for you to come along anyway!

        Presented by: Tim
An introductory look at the the various tools and techniques for performing man in the middle attacks, as well as the techniques and tips to defend against them.
The presentation will include a few demos of the tools and a show and tell of devices which can be used to make the attacks easier.
For those new to MitM attacks, this is a very powerful technique used to intercept and modify network traffic (which is why encryption is so important!

A talk by one of our members on the common tools and techniques used to break into a server, starting from enumeration and going to full exploitation.
For anyone wanting to play along, please bring a laptop with Kali installed (a virtual machine is okay - make sure you have the latest version of wpscan by running the command &ldquo;wpscan &ndash;update&rdquo;) as well as a copy of this vm

        Presented by: Jay
Software Defined Radio (SDR) is a cheap and easy way to listen to and interact with radio devices. In this workshop, we&rsquo;ll look at the capabilities of SDR, discuss common weaknesses in radio systems (such as wireless keyfobs and wireless keyboard) and look into ways these can be exploited with cheap and readily available hardware.
For this workshop, you will need a laptop with gnuradio companion, SDR# or qqrx and capable of running SDR drivers (these should all be available in Kali Linux).
